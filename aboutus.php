				<p>G B Pant Engineering College was established by the Govt. of NCT of Delhi in the year 2007 with the aim of imparting quality technical education for the students of Delhi and nearby areas. Since its inception, the faculty and staff have been tirelessly working towards the growth of the institution.</p> <p> Affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and approved by AICTE, the college started with two batches of students, one each for Mechanical Engineering and Electronics and Communications Engineering courses. Increasing its horizon in the year 2010, a batch of Computer Engineering course was started in the college. With the presence of vibrant and dynamic faculty members of highest academic calibre selected by UPSC, G B Pant has been able to produce three batches of engineering graduates who have been pursuing their careers in companies and higher education institutes in India and abroad. </p> <p> The college has been operating from its building in G B Pant Polytechnic campus which has been transformed to be equipped with ultra-modern facilities. The college has already established various labs for all the branches with up to date modern equipment which ensures that the students are trained in the practical realm according to the current industry standards. The college is in the process of making its own building with state of the art facilities </p>
				<h2 id="principalsdesk">From Principal's desk</h2>
				<p>It is indeed a great pleasure for me to mark the presence of Govind Ballabh Pant Engineering College (GBPEC) in the highly competitive world. It is a matter of immense pride that GBPEC continues to be one of the highly sought after institutions affiliated to the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprashta University (GGSIPU) for admissions to engineering and technology programs. We recognize that the fast growing technological developments in all fields are challenging and industry requires multi-skilled talent. We have attempted to successfully adapt ourselves to this challenge with the active support of the Govt. of Delhi incorporating modern infrastructural facilities to craft "engineers of tomorrow", with a culture of high sense of dedication, determination, discipline and passion. At GBPEC, we believe that the sequence of activities must have a positive impact on our students' academic and personal development and we are engaged in providing to the industry with engineers who would have capabilities to participate in the ongoing technological revolution with ease and speed, as well as with professionalism and moral values. At this fast evolving institute, our focus is on providing an ambience conducive to developing a career rather than to just getting a job. I am delighted to inform you that, the college has earned its place amongst the upcoming institutes of excellence of Delhi, with a potential to develop into a world-class centre of higher technical education over the coming years. I wish all my students, a great success in all their endeavours. </p> <p> <br/> <br /> </p> <p> WITH BEST WISHES.<br /> Prof. O. P. Verma<br /> Principal<br /> <a href="doc/profiles/Dr_OP_Verma.pdf" target="_blank">(Principal's Profile)</a></p>
